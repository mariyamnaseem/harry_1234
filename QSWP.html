<h4>Quebec Skilled Worker Program (QSWP)</h4>
<p>The QSWP operates on a points-based system, where applicants are assessed based on various factors such as education, work experience, language proficiency in French and/or English, age, and adaptability. Successful applicants receive a Quebec Selection Certificate (Certificat de sélection du Québec, or CSQ), which is a prerequisite for applying for Canadian permanent residence through Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC). The program aims to attract individuals with the skills and experience needed to contribute to Quebec's economy and society, while also respecting the province's linguistic and cultural heritage.</p>
